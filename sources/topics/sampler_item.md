# sampler item

The sampler is used to play .wav or .ogg files. Using OSWeb, it can also play .mp3 files.

Options: 

- Volume: a numeric value where 0 is silence and 1 is the original volume
- Panning: a numeric value where negative is panning left and positive is panning right; 'left' for full-left panning; 'right' for full-right panning.
- Stop after: a value in milliseconds after which the sound is truncated.
- Fade in: a value in milliseconds
- Duration: a numeric duration in milliseconds (after which the experiment continues while the sound continues to play), 'sound' (to wait until the sound is finished playing), 'keypress' (to wait until a key is pressed) or 'mouseclick' (to wait until a mouse button is clicked).
