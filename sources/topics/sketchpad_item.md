# Sketchpad Features

-   Duration Setting: a numeric value (duration in milliseconds), `keypress` or `mouseclick`.
-	View Options: Top right; choose from "view control", "view script", or "split view".
-	Show-if Expression: Determines whether or not a particular element should be shown. Show-if expressions in sketchpad items are evaluated during the prepare phase, which occurs before the trial starts. Therefor, you cannot use show-if expressions in sketchpads to conditionally show elements based on something that happens during the trial.
