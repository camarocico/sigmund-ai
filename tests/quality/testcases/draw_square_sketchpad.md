How can i draw a square in a sketchpad item?

the answer should: 

-   Instruct to open your sketchpad item to configure it.
-   Click on the ‘Draw rectangle’ tool (usually represented by a rectangle icon in the toolbar).
-   Click and drag on the canvas within the sketchpad to draw the rectangle.
-   After drawing the rectangle, you can adjust its properties such as position, size, and color. Make sure that the width and height values are the same to form a square.

The answer should *not*:

- Refer to Python inline_script or contain other Python code
- Refer to JavaScript inline_javascript or contain other JavaScript code
- State that you can hold down the shift key while dragging to make sure all sides are equal and thus create a perfect square.
