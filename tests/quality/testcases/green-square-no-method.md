How do I display a green square at the middle of the screen? 

the answer should contain at least *one* of the three options below, it does *not* need to contain al options: 

 1. inquire what method (GUI or python inline_script or JavaScript inline_javascript) the user prefers to use to complete this task , or: 
 2. give instructions to complete the task, for all possible methods (GUI or python inline_script or JavaScript inline_javascript), or: 
 3. give instructions to complete the task, using only one method while also informing the user  that there are other methods available as well. It does not need to give instructions for the other viable methods, it only has to mention them. 

The answer should *not*:

- Assume which single method the user wants to use and give the instructions for *only* that method wihtout informing the user about the other viable methods.
