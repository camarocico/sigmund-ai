Where can I find the run-if expression that determines if my sketchpad is run?

The answer should: 

-	Instruct the user to navigate to the sequence item that contains the sketchpad. 
-   Within the sequence item, identify your sketchpad item. 
-   There is a column in the sequence called "Run if". Click on the cell next to your sketchpad item in this column. This is where you can enter the run-if expression.

The answer should *not*: 

-	State that the run-if expression can be found at the bottom of the sketchpad item's properties, after clicking on the sketchpad item
