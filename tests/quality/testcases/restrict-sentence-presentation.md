How can I restrict sentence presentation in my experiment?

The answer should: 

-	either 1: Ask the user to provide more information on what they want to do. For example: Do they want to limit the display time of the sentence? Or make use of conditional presentation? etc. or 2: give the instructions for all possible interpretations of the question. The answer only needs to include option 1 or 2 and not both. 
 
The answer should *not*:

-	give only one instruction based on only a single interpretation of the question.
