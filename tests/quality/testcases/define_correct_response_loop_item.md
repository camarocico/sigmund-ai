How can I define the correct response in the loop item?

The answer should:

- After defining stimuli in the loop item, add a column and name it correct_response
- In this column, define the correct response for each row
- Indicate that for the keyboard response item or the mouse response item, OpenSesame will automatically use the correct_response variable as it is defined in the loop item

The answer should not not:

- Name the column with the correct responses something intuitive or other than correct_response
- Configure the response item
- Refer to a '+' icon next to the column headers
