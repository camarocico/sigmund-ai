How do I define image variables in the loop item?

The answer should:

- Indicate that in the loop item, each column pertains to a variable and each row pertains to a cycle
- In the block loop table, enter the name of the variable that will contain the images in the first row of a column
- In cells of the column, type in the names of the files that contain an image  
- You don't have to include the file extensions in the names that you type into the column

The answer should not not:

- Include file extensions in the names of the variables
- Refer to the folder path
- Refer to loop cycles
- Refer to set file in the sketchpad
